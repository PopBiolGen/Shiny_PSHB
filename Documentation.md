#### PSHB Survey Planner

This app has been designed as a tool to assist with the monitoring and
management of the polyphagous shot hole borer (PSHB, *Euwallacea
fornicatus*) in Australia. It predicts the best times of the year to
conduct PSHB surveys as part of a management plan.

Identifying new PSHB outbreaks early is critical for effective
management. PSHB surveillance is conducted using lured traps (to catch
beetles flying between trees) and/or inspecting potential host trees for
signs of attack. It takes time and resources to detect PSHB when it is
present, and continuous survey efforts are not always feasible.

Survey efforts should be prioritised at times when 1) PSHB is most
likely to be detected, and 2) when outbreaks pose the biggest threat of
spreading. This occurs when there is a higher abundance of beetles
flying to and attacking new trees. This app predicts when beetles will
be most abundant, according to weather data.

##### Step 1: Select a location.

Click on the map to select a location. PSHB population growth will be
calculated over one year using daily climate data for the location.
Daily growth rates are summed over a 30-day window, to give weight to
extended periods of high growth.

##### Step 2: Select number of survey weeks.

Adjust the total number of weeks in a year during which PSHB surveys can
be conducted. The selected number of weeks with the highest PSHB growth
are highlighted in **<span style="color:lightblue">blue</span>**. These
periods (simplified to months in the calendars) are the best times to
use resources for surveillance.<br>

NOTE: Predictions are based on 10-year averages for daily temperature.
Actual PSHB activity will vary depending on current climate.<br>
