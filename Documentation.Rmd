This app has been designed as a tool to assist with the monitoring and management of the polyphagous shot hole borer (PSHB, *Euwallacea fornicatus*) in Australia.

PSHB surveillance involves using lured traps and/or inspecting potential host trees for signs of infestation. Early identification of new outbreaks is critical for managing this pest effectively. However, continuous survey efforts are not always feasible. This app predicts the best times of the year to conduct surveys as part of a broader PSHB management plan.

Surveys are more likely to detect PSHB when there is an higher abundance of beetles in the flying stage of their life cycle. This is when new trees are attacked, and when beetles are caught by traps. Surveys will therefore be most successful during periods of high population growth. Population growth is determined by temperature.

###### Step 1: Select a location.

Click on the map to select a location. PSHB population growth will be calculated over one year using daily climate data for the location. Daily growth rates are summed over a 30-day window, to give weight to extended periods of high growth.

###### Step 2: Select number of survey weeks.

Adjust the total number of weeks in a year during which PSHB surveys can be conducted. The selected number of weeks with the highest PSHB growth are highlighted in <span style="color:lightblue">blue</span>. These periods (simplified to months in the calendars) are the best times to use resources for surveillance.

NOTE: Predictions are based on 10-year averages for daily temperature. Actual PSHB activity will vary depending on current climate.

This app is built using the temperature-dependent PSHB population model described in:
